            <p>An Arcane Study is a place of quiet research that contains one or more desks and bookshelves.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Arcane Study Charm.</em></strong> After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a
                magical Charm (see “<a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#SupernaturalGifts">Supernatural
                    Gifts</a>” in <a href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox">chapter 3</a>) that
                lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast <a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/spells/2619180-identify">Identify</a> without expending a spell slot or
                using Material components. You can’t gain this Charm again while you still have it.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Craft Options.</em></strong> When you issue the Craft order to this facility, choose one of
                the following options:</p>
            <p><strong>Craft: Arcane Focus.</strong> You commission the facility’s hireling to craft an <a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/equipment/544-arcane-focus">Arcane Focus</a>. The work takes 7 days and
                costs no money. The Arcane Focus remains in your Bastion until you claim it.</p>
            <p><strong>Craft: Book.</strong> You commission the facility’s hireling to craft a blank book. The work
                takes 7 days and costs you 10 GP. The book remains in your Bastion until you claim it.</p>
            <p><strong>Craft: Magic Item (Arcana).</strong> If you are level 9+, you can commission the facility’s
                hireling to craft a Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the <a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items#ArcanaTables">Arcana tables</a>
                in <a href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/random-magic-items">chapter 7</a>. The facility
                has the tool required to craft the item, and the hireling has proficiency with that tool as well as
                proficiency in the <a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Arcana</a> skill. See
                the “<a href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure#CraftingMagicItems">Crafting Magic
                    Items</a>” section in <a href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure">chapter 7</a>
                for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the item allows its user to cast any
                spells from it, you must craft the item yourself (the facility’s hireling can assist), and you must have
                all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.</p>

            </div>
            <p>An Archive is a repository of valuable books, maps, and scrolls. It is usually attached to a Library
                behind a locked or secret door.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Research: Helpful Lore.</em></strong> When you issue the Research order to this facility, you
                commission the facility’s hireling to search the Archive for helpful lore. The work takes 7 days. The
                hireling gains knowledge as if they had cast the <a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/spells/2619010-legend-lore">Legend Lore</a> spell, then shares this
                knowledge with you the next time you speak with them.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Reference Book.</em></strong> Your Archive contains one copy of a rare and valuable reference
                book, which gives you a benefit while you and the book are in your Bastion. You can choose one of the
                following options (your DM might make more options available):</p>

            <p><strong><em>Enlarging the Facility.</em></strong> You can enlarge your Archive to a Vast facility by
                spending 2,000 GP. If you do so, you gain two additional reference books chosen from the list above.</p>

            <h3>Armory</h3>

                <p><strong>Order:</strong> Trade</p>
            </div>
            <p>An Armory contains mannequins for displaying armor, hooks for holding Shields, racks for storing weapons,
                and chests for holding ammunition.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Trade: Stock Armory.</em></strong> When you issue the Trade order to this facility, you
                commission the facility’s hireling to stock the Armory with armor, <a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/equipment/8-shield">Shields</a>, weapons, and ammunition. This equipment
                costs you 100 GP plus an extra 100 GP for each Bastion Defender in your Bastion. If your Bastion has a
                Smithy, the total cost is halved.</p>
            <p>While your Armory is stocked, your Bastion Defenders are harder to kill. When any event causes you to
                roll dice to determine if your Bastion loses one or more of its defenders (see “Bastion Events” at the
                end of this chapter), roll 1d8 in place of each d6 you would normally roll. When the event is over, the
                equipment in your Armory is expended regardless of how many Bastion Defenders you have or how many you
                lost, leaving your Armory depleted until you issue another Trade order to the facility and pay the cost
                to restock it.</p>

            </div>
            <p>A Bastion can have more than one Barrack, each of which is furnished to serve as sleeping quarters for up
                to twelve Bastion Defenders.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Recruit: Bastion Defenders.</em></strong> Each time you issue the Recruit order to this
                facility, up to four Bastion Defenders are recruited to your Bastion and assigned quarters in this
                Barrack. The recruitment costs no money. You can’t issue the Recruit order to this facility if it’s
                fully occupied.</p>
            <p>Keep track of the Bastion Defenders housed in each of your Barracks. If you lose Bastion Defenders,
                deduct them from your roster. Assign names and personalities to your Bastion Defenders as you see fit.
            </p>
            <p><strong><em>Enlarging the Facility.</em></strong> You can enlarge your Barrack to a Vast facility by
                spending 2,000 GP. A Vast Barrack can accommodate up to twenty-five Bastion Defenders.</p>

                relocate this door to another facility in your Bastion.</p>
            <p>Only you and your Bastion’s hirelings can open the door, which leads to a Demiplane that takes the form
                of a stone room. The Demiplane exists in an extradimensional space and therefore isn’t attached
                physically to other locations in your Bastion. Neither the Demiplane nor its door can be dispelled.</p>

                commission the facility’s hireling to research a topic. The topic can be a legend, a known event or
                location, a person of significance, a type of creature, or a famous object. The work takes 7 days. When
                the research concludes, the hireling obtains up to three accurate pieces of information about the topic
                that were previously unknown to you and shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with
                them. The DM determines what information you learn.</p>

                Bastion’s hirelings can use the Meditation Chamber to gain a measure of inner peace. The next time you
                roll for a Bastion event, you can roll twice and choose either result.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Fortify Self.</em></strong> You can meditate in this facility over a period of 7 days. If you
                leave the Bastion during this time, you gain no benefit. Otherwise, at the end of the seventh day, you
                gain Advantage on two kinds of saving throws for the next 7 days, determined randomly by rolling on the
                table below. Reroll if you get a duplicate result.</p>

            <p>Folks come here to consume tasty beverages and socialize. Your Pub might be a bar, coffee shop, or tea
                room, and it might have a colorful name, such as the Rusty Flagon or the Dragon’s Loft. The facility’s
                hireling, who serves as the bartender, maintains a network of spies scattered throughout nearby
                communities. These spies are useful sources of information and frequent the Pub, often incognito.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Research: Information Gathering.</em></strong> When you issue the Research order to this
                facility, you commission the Pub’s bartender to gather information from spies who are aware of all
                important events happening within 10 miles of your Bastion over the next 7 days. During that time, these
                spies can divulge the location of any creature that is familiar to you, provided the creature is within
                50 miles of your Bastion and not hidden by magic or confined to a location that the DM deems is beyond
                the spy network’s ability to locate. If the spies learn the target’s location, they also learn where
                that creature has been for the previous 7 days.</p>

                Charm (see “<a

            <p><strong><em>Harvest: Talisman.</em></strong> When you issue the Harvest order to this facility, you
                commission its hireling to produce a specially prepared talisman for your use. The talisman usually
                takes the form of an amulet, a rune-carved box, or a statuette, but it can be any Tiny, nonmagical
                object that has religious significance. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. You can use this
                talisman in place of one spell’s Material components, provided the components have a cost of 1,000 GP or
                less. If the spell normally consumes its components, the talisman isn’t consumed. After the talisman has
                been used in this way, it can’t be used again until you return it to your Reliquary and use another
                Harvest order to prepare it.</p>

            <p>A Storehouse is a cool, dark space meant to contain trade goods objects from the <a

            <p><strong><em>Trade: Goods.</em></strong> When you issue the Trade order to this facility, its hireling
                spends the next 7 days procuring nonmagical items that have a total value of 500 GP or less and stores
                them in the Storehouse, or the hireling uses those 7 days to sell goods in the Storehouse. You bear the
                total cost of any purchases, and the maximum value of the items purchased increases to 2,000 GP when you
                reach level 9 and 5,000 GP when you reach level 13.</p>
            <p>When you sell goods from your Storehouse, the buyer pays you 10 percent more than the standard price;
                this profit increases to 20 percent when you reach level 9, 50 percent when you reach level 13, and 100
                percent when you reach level 17.</p>

            <p>Inscribed on the floor of this room is a permanent teleportation circle created by the <a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/spells/2619167-teleportation-circle">Teleportation Circle</a> spell.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Recruit: Spellcaster.</em></strong> Each time you issue the Recruit order to this facility,
                its hireling extends an invitation to a Friendly NPC spellcaster. Roll any die. If the number rolled is
                odd, the invitee declines the invitation, and you gain no benefit from having issued the order. If the
                number rolled is even, the invitee accepts the invitation and arrives in your Bastion via your
                Teleportation Circle.</p>
            <p>While you are in your Bastion, you can ask the spellcaster to cast one Wizard spell of level 4 or lower;
                if you are level 17+, the spell’s maximum level increases to 8. The spellcaster is assumed to have the
                spell prepared. If the spell has one or more Material components that cost money, you must pay for them
                before the spell can be cast.</p>
            <p>The spellcaster stays for 14 days or until they cast a spell for you. The spellcaster won’t defend your
                Bastion and departs immediately if the Bastion is attacked (see “Bastion Events” at the end of the
                chapter).</p>

            <p>The Theater contains a stage, a backstage area where props and sets are kept, and a seating area for a
                small audience.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Empower: Theatrical Event.</em></strong> When you issue the Empower order to this facility,
                its hirelings begin work on a theatrical production or concert. Rehearsals and other preparations take
                14 days, followed by at least 7 days of performances. The performances can continue indefinitely until a
                new production gets underway.</p>
            <p>You or another character can contribute to a production in the following ways:</p>
            <p><strong>Composer/Writer.</strong> A character can compose music or write a script for a concert or
                production that hasn’t started rehearsals yet. This effort takes 14 days.</p>
            <p><strong>Conductor/Director.</strong> A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the
                production can serve as the concert’s conductor or the production’s director.</p>
            <p><strong>Performer.</strong> A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the rehearsal
                period can be a star performer in one or more of the performances; one of the Theater’s hirelings can
                serve as an understudy for additional performances.</p>
            <p>At the end of a rehearsal period, each character who contributed to the concert or production can make a
                DC 15 Charisma (<a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Performance</a>) check.
                If more of these checks succeed than fail, you and any other character who contributed to the concert or
                production each gain a Theater die, a d6. This die changes to a d8 when you reach level 13 and a d10
                when you reach level 17. At any point after the rehearsals end, a character can expend their Theater die
                to roll it and add the number rolled to one <a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test">D20 Test</a> they make,
                immediately after rolling the d20. If a character hasn’t expended their Theater die before gaining
                another, their first die is lost.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Research Options.</em></strong> When you issue the Research order to this facility, choose
                one of the following options:</p>
            <p><strong>Research: Lore.</strong> You commission the facility’s hireling to research a topic of your
                choice. The topic can be a legend, any kind of creature, or a famous object. The topic need not be
                directly related to items on display in the room, as the trophies provide clues to research a wide
                variety of other subjects. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, the hireling obtains up
                to three accurate pieces of information about the topic that were previously unknown to you and shares
                this knowledge with you the next time you speak with them. The DM determines what information is
                learned.</p>
            <p><strong>Research: Trinket Trophy.</strong> You commission the facility’s hireling to search for a trinket
                that might be of use to you. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, roll any die. If the
                number rolled is odd, the hireling finds nothing useful. If the number rolled is even, the hireling
                finds a magic item. Roll on the <a

                    Manual</em>) whose alignment matches yours. You start with two lieutenants but can add more, as
                described below. If your Bastion lacks facilities to house your lieutenants, they secure accommodations
                in the inn or settlement closest to your Bastion. Lieutenants are hirelings, not Bastion Defenders;
                however, if your Bastion is attacked (see “Bastion Events” at the end of this chapter), each lieutenant
                housed in your Bastion reduces by 1 the number of dice you roll to determine how many Bastion Defenders
                are lost in the attack.</p>
            <p>The War Room contains war memorabilia plus a large table surrounded by enough chairs for you and your

            <p><strong><em>Recruit Options.</em></strong> When you issue the Recruit order to this facility, choose one
                of the following options:</p>
            <p><strong>Recruit: Lieutenant.</strong> You gain one new lieutenant. You can have up to ten lieutenants at
                any time. Assign names and personalities to them as you see fit.</p>
            <p><strong>Recruit: Soldiers.</strong> You commission one or more of your lieutenants to assemble a small
                army. Each lieutenant can muster one hundred <a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/monsters/16915-guard">Guards</a> (see the <em>Monster Manual</em>) in 7
                days to fight for your cause. Reduce that number to twenty if you want them to be mounted on <a

                    Manual</em>). It costs you 1 GP per day to feed each guard and each horse in your army. Wherever the
                army goes, it must be led by you or at least one of your lieutenants, or else it disbands immediately.
                The army also disbands if it goes 1 day without being fed. Otherwise, the army remains until it is
                destroyed or you command it to disband. You can’t issue this Recruit order again until your current army

                facility has the tool required to craft the item, and the hirelings have proficiency with that tool as
                well as proficiency in the <a
                    href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills">Arcana</a> skill. See
                the “<a href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure#CraftingMagicItems">Crafting Magic
                    Items</a>” section in <a href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/treasure">chapter 7</a>
                for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the item allows its user to cast any
                spells from it, you must craft the item yourself (the facility’s hirelings can assist), and you must
                have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Source of Inspiration.</em></strong> After spending an entire Short Rest in your Workshop,
                you gain <a href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HeroicInspiration">Heroic
                    Inspiration</a>. You can’t gain this benefit again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Enlarging the Facility.</em></strong> You can enlarge your Workshop to a Vast facility by
                spending 2,000 GP. If you do so, the Workshop gains two additional hirelings and three additional
                Artisan’s Tools (chosen from the list above).</p>
